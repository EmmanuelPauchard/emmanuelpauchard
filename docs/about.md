My name is Emmanuel Pauchard and I am a software engineer. I live in France near the town of [Annecy](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/fr/map/annecy-74_189659#12/45.9009/6.1280), a beautiful region of lakes and mountains. I have been working on embedded systems for 10 years mostly because I like working on the border between hardware and software. Plus, it's always exciting to work on physical products!

My main domain of interests are smart devices, which include the following fields:
* connectivity: protocols, standards. How to make things interoperable in an efficient way
* low power: ensure smart devices help us save energy and not cost us more as many gadgets do
* reliability and operational safety, particularly in critical environments
* tests: I enjoy setting up test frameworks (usually in Python) and try to bring new ideas on how to test embedded devices more easily

Apart from software engineering, I enjoy being very active in the Systems specification and I strive to always include in my projects a clear documentation. My ideal documentation toolchain is be:
* a system level requirements specification in a text (markdown) document in a git repo (with markups to identify each requirement and open up traceability)
* a software design documentation directly present in the source code ([doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/) and [plantuml](https://plantuml.com/en/) are my best friends)
* a test specification directly in the Python test scripts (I love using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/)), with marks set-up to close the traceability loop

At home, I really like fixing stuff, or working on personal projects that involve electronics and or software. My goal is to show these realizations on this site and hopefully get some feedback or provide help or inspiration to others(I have been always helped and inspired by looking at other's projects!).

When not working on a computer, I like riding on a bike (mountain or road), hiking, reading or just being with my family (2 children: 5 and 2).
